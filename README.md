# RSVP

This is the RSVP app being used by [FOSSTR](http://fosstr.org/)

The app has been heavily influenced by [bitmazk/django-event-rsvp](https://github.com/bitmazk/django-event-rsvp) and [toastdriven/django-rsvp](https://github.com/toastdriven/django-rsvp) but has been simplified and tuned for our needs

Feel free to use, improve and send us a pull request
